	abstract = {The determination of mapping units, including grid, slope, unique condition, administrative division, and watershed units, is a very important modeling basis for landslide assessments. Among these mapping units, the slope unit has been paid a lot of attention because it can effectively reflect the physical relationships between landslides and the fundamental topographic elements especially in mountainous areas. Although some methods have been proposed for slope unit extraction, effectively and automatically extracting slope units remains a difficult and urgent problem that seriously restricts the use of slope units. To overcome this problem, the innovative multi-scale segmentation (MSS) method is proposed for extracting slope units. Thus, first, the terrain aspect and shaded relief images obtained from the digital elevation model with certain weights are used as the data sources of the MSS method. Second, the scale, shape, and compactness parameters of the MSS method are properly determined according to the improved trial-and-error method. Third, the initial slope units generated by the MSS method with appropriate parameters are automatically optimized through vector analysis in GIS. Finally, reasonable slope units are obtained and the extraction performance is discussed. The Chongyi County and Wanzhou District in China are selected as study areas. The conventional hydrological method is also adopted to extract slope units for qualitative and quantitative comparisons. It can be concluded that the MSS method can accurately and automatically extract the slope units for landslide assessments in hilly and mountainous areas and performs better than the hydrological method.},
