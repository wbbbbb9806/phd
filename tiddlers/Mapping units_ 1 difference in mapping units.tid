Huang, F. et al. Efficient and automatic extraction of slope units based on multi-scale segmentation method for landslide assessments. Landslides 18, 3715â€“3731 (2021).

(Huang et al., 2021)

The main used mapping units include grid units, slope units, unique condition units and small watershed units. 

The small watershed units are more suitable for risk assessment of the debris flow and flood since a watershed contains several slopes.

The multi-scale segmentation(MSS) method is based on the princeple of maxmum regional internal Homogeneity and heterogeneity between units.


The terrain aspect and shaded relif images were used to divide slope units.

However, they think that the patition of slope units also need to regard other features.
